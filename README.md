Setting up the project

Follow the steps below to set up the bot and get it running.

### 1. Clone the repository

First, clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vulpes231/rabbit-bot.git
cd your-python-bot
```

2. Create a virtual environment

Itâ€™s recommended to create a virtual environment to isolate the dependencies of this project. To do so, run the following command:

python3 -m venv venv

This will create a new virtual environment named venv in your project folder. 3. Activate the virtual environment

To activate the virtual environment, run the appropriate command based on your operating system.
On macOS and Linux:

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

On Windows:

```bash
.\venv\Scripts\activate
```

You should now see (venv) in your terminal prompt, indicating that the virtual environment is active. 4. Install dependencies

With the virtual environment activated, install the required Python packages by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This will install all the dependencies listed in the requirements.txt file. 5. Running the bot

Once the dependencies are installed, you can run the bot using:

```bash
python main.py
```
